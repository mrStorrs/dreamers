# Logging Discipline

Rules for log calls — what to write, what to flag in review.

1. **Project rule first.** If the project specifies a logging convention in `CLAUDE.md`, it is the binding spec.
2. **Else: match surrounding code.** Existing log calls in the same module and nearest neighbors define:
   - Logger library / import path (do not introduce a new logger where one already exists).
   - Level conventions in use (ERROR / WARN / INFO / DEBUG, or whatever the codebase uses).
   - Message format (structured fields vs interpolated strings, key names, casing).
3. **Never log:** secrets, tokens, PII, full request/response bodies. No exceptions.
4. **Neither rule yields a clear answer** → raise an open question via `AskUserQuestion` rather than guessing.
